            WiE Colloquium is a program focusing on WiE AG members (female engineering
            aspirants) to surge and update the technical knowledge. It is a panel discussion
            with 2 phases of which at the first phase all WiE AGs are divided into 9 groups and
            are given the pillars of Industry 4.0 . The second phase will be on the topic:
            on 28th April 2020, under the supervision of YPs from WiE, phase 1 was
            Industry 4.0 coordinated by IEEE LINK as the final event of WiE Colloquium.
            Grouping of WiE AGs was conducted from 22nd-24th April 2020. Phase 1 started
            is selected for Phase 2 execution.
            WIE Colloquium has catered to bringing together a vast community of technically
            technological development under their wings. The primary aim of the event was
            empowered women who have embraced innovation and shortlisted ideas for
            too engage female engineering aspirants in technical discussions on the latest
            developments. The enthusiasm and participation that the event inspired
            demonstrated that student culture at IEEE. The other outcomes of this event are..
            backbone for the less active WIE AGs of a few Student Branches.
            We believe that this event has ignited many young minds with the latest techs
            and trends and have given a proper insight to the pillars of Industry 4.0.
            successfully completed on 9th May 2020. Best panelist from each of the 9 topics

                    Venus–The epitome of WiEness,the WiE week celebration was observed from March7–March13,2020.The event brought all Women’s day celebrations
                    under a single structure,the Venus.The week was dedicated to celebrate women’s achievements in the social,economic,cultural and political spheres.
                    The IEEE WiE Community  focused on conducting out reach programs at SB Levels,unfortunately many couldn’t complete due to the hit by the pandemic COVID19
                    Many of the structured WiE week celebrations were then conducted using online platforms.
                    Venus have helped girls in excelling in practical living from the classroom to the outerWorld.This is done by providing female students with education,exposure,
                    and experience.The gender gap that still persists in the society can only be minimized through such events.The out reach programs have significantly helped
                    the women out there in the society,which turns out to be the highlight of Venus.
